# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
With SQL involved, we have determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Our report summarizes our analysis and helps prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results

* Out of the 90,398 employees, a majority in the retiring titles have the title of Senior Engineer, specially 29,414
* The minority in the same table are managers, with only 2

* Those in the mentorship eligibilty have currently ongoing employment
* Only 1550 are eligible for mentorship

## Summary

It would seem approximately 90,398 roles will need to be filled to prepare for a "silver tsunami" to make an impact. It seems from the mentorship eligibilty table, it is not enough as the population continues to increase. Perhaps running with updated data would help, assuming the numbers would increase. Another recommendation would be to revise the data with current employees assuming the previous one included former employees.
